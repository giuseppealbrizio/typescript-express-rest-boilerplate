# Typescript Rest Boilerplate

#### Typescript REST microservice boilerplate using node.js and express and some other cool stuff

This template is intended to be used as single service in a REST multi-service application using Cloud Pub/Sub as
message broker

The main difference with the previous template is the folder infra in which you can find all the GKE configurations to
use in local with Skaffold and in cloud with GKE

To know more about how to implement GKE and run with Skaffold please refer to this folder:

`./infra`

The application uses express as framework and is configured with the following features:

- `ECMA2020` features enabled
- `Dotenv` Load environment variables from .env file
- `Eslint` Code quality tool
- `Prettier` to prettify the code
- `MongoDB` ready to go configuration with mongoose
- `MySQL` ready to go configuration with mysql2
- `Sequelize` ready to go configuration with sequelize
- `CORS` feature enabled
- `RBAC` logic to authorize people with specific roles to use the endpoints.
- `Passport` logic to add an authentication layer if neeeded.
- `Sendgrid` email service support with sendgrid.
- `Error Handling` errors custom middleware and helpers globally configured
- `Multer` File uploading configured to use in routes as middleware
- `Google Cloud Storage` middleware configured to use Google Cloud Storage as upload bucket
- `Google Cloud Pub/Sub` pub/sub support for event driven events added
- `Axios` globally configured in `./src/utils/api.utils.js`
- `Swagger` documentation reachable at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs`
- `Jest` Testing tool support
- `Logger` Logging support with Winston
- `Docker` ready configuration with multi-stage option
- `Best practices` in naming files

## Getting Started

Copy the .env.example to .env

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Then replace:

1. `MONGO_URI` string with your Mongo connection
   1. `MONGO_URI_TEST` string with your Mongo Test connection
2. `MYSQL_HOST_STAGE` string with your mysql host name
   - `MYSQL_USER_STAGE` string with your mysql username
   - `MYSQL_PASSWORD_STAGE` string with your mysql password name
   - `MYSQL_DB_STAGE` string with your mysql db name
   - `MYSQL_SOCKET_STAGE` string with your mysql socket name
3. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path with yours
4. `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` with yours
5. `SENDGRID_API_KEY` with yours
6. `SENDGRID_SENDER_EMAIL` with yours

In order to Google Cloud Storage works follow instructions located in `./src/config/gcloud/README.md`

---

To get started with this repo npm install in the root folder

```bash
npm install
```

To getting started with a dev environment. Here we use nodemon and babel-node to restart the server asa we change
something

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

To transpile the code and create a production build

```bash
npm run transpile
```

This command will create a build in the root directory

To start with a production ready build you can run this command

```bash
# This set the NODE_ENV to production, npm-run-all, create a build and run the server command
npm run start
```

If you have a build and you want to node the build you can run

```bash
# This command launch the node instance inside the ./build/bin/server
npm run server
```

## Docker Ready

### Here we use the multistage build to optimize speed and size of the final image

If you use Docker and wanna dockerize the app you can run the command

```bash
docker build -t <dockerhubusername>/<docker-image-name>:<tag> .
```

then

```bash
docker run --name <docker-process-name> -d - p 3000:3000 <dockerhubusername>/<docker-image-name>:<tag>
```
